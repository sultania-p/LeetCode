Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


---
Create table Logs (id int, num int)

Truncate table Logs

insert into Logs (id, num) values ('1', '1')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('2', '1')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('3', '1')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('4', '2')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('5', '1')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('6', '2')
insert into Logs (id, num) values ('7', '2')
delete from logs where id = 3
select * from logs

*/

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

select distinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums from logs l1 
join logs l2 on (l1.id = l2.id+1) and l1.num = l2.num
join logs l3 on (l1.id = l3.id+2) and l1.num = l3.num
